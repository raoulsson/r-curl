## RCurl

A class that helps to curl in PHP.

## Installation

RCurl is available on Packagist and as such installable via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require raoulsson/rcurl
```

If you do not use Composer, you can grab the code from GitHub, and use any
PSR-0 compatible autoloader (e.g. the [Symfony2 ClassLoader component](https://github.com/symfony/ClassLoader))
to use RCurl.
